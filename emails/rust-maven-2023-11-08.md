Welcome to the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) newsletter.

This is the first email after launching the newsletter. I am really happy that so many people signed up.

Thank you!


I had to wait with newsletter a few days as I realized the [code base](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.rs) I was using to send the emails
could only work from the cloned copy of the code-base. This happened as it was reading a data file from a folder relative to the code.

This data file is part of the application, mapping file extensions to format types, but I did not want to distribute the file in its original text format.
I wanted to bake the data into the executable.

So this is what I was working on yesterday and today and this resulted in 3 new posts as well:

* [Embedding string, embedding text file](https://rust.code-maven.com/embedding-text-file)
* [Embed list of values](https://rust.code-maven.com/embed-list-of-values)
* [Embedding simple CSV file in Rust application](https://rust.code-maven.com/embedding-simple-csv-file)

I hope some of these examples will help you as well.

If you like the content please share it with other and recommend them too to sign up to the newsletter.

regards

  Gabor
