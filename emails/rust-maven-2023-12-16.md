Hi,

Now that the Google Analytics works again I can see that yesterday there were almost 400 visitors on the Rust Maven website.
We are on the right track!

My earlier experience with the Perl Maven and the Code Maven sites shows that in the last 2 weeks of December the activity falls
by 50-70%, so I don't expect a lot of visitors in the next 2 weeks, but I hope I'll be able to publish articles nevertheless.


## Articles

This is actually a series of articles:

* [Getting started with Tiny HTTP building a web application in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/tiny-http)

I would love to see you try this "framework" and let me know what other features would you like to see described in the articles.

Write a small app  of a calculator, the number guessing game, or if you also want to deal with the filesystem then a counter
or a todo list.

## Slides

No new [Rust slides](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/)
