title: "[Rust Maven] CLI and YAML files"

Hi,

I made some progress on the [Site Checker](https://site-checker.code-maven.com/), but less than I was hoping for.

On the other hand I wrote two articles:

* [ARGV - command line parameters for simple CLI program](https://rust.code-maven.com/argv-simple-command-line-parameters)
* [Read arbitrary YAML files in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/read-arbitrary-yaml)


## I have a problem

One of my personal problems is that I think I am a bit addicted to feedback. Without seeing that my work helps others
my motivation shrinks. So if you'd like to help me get more work done on any of my [Open Source Rust projects](https://szabgab.com/rust)
or if you'd like to motivate me to write more articles, then please give some feedback. Tell me if something was useful,
ask for a new feature of a project, for a new article or, just share one of the articles on a social network and mention me.
I am available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/szabgab), or
even [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/szabgab529).


enjoy!
