Hi,

Welcome to the new subscribers!

Please invite others to the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) web site and to this newsletter.

## Frequency

I just realized I have not sent out the newsletter for 6 days. In the meantime I made at least 6 posts on the Rust Maven site and
on on my personal site. I should make sure that I send you an email every day when I made new posts.

So what do we have now


## Articles

* [Diverging Functions - functions that never return](https://rust.code-maven.com/diverging-functions)
* [Exclamation mark in Rust !](https://rust.code-maven.com/exclamation-mark)
* [Boolean not !](https://rust.code-maven.com/boolean-not)
* [Compiler Error codes in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/error-codes)
* [Commafy - add a comma after every 3 digits](https://rust.code-maven.com/commafy)

## Meetups

I collected 39 Rust Meetup and user groups from around the world. I'd like to encourage you to sign up to a group
near-by where you live. There are also plenty of online meetings listed on [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)
that you can attend from anywhere.

## Reddit

In an attempt to understand how much Rust developers use social networks and social web sites I collected a list of Subreddits
of 50 programming languages along with the number of members. Surprisingly Rust has the 5th biggest Subreddit.

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


enjoy!

ps. I just realized that the footer (that now you will see below this line) was not included in my previous messages. Oups. Now fixed.
