Hi,

Roughly 3 weeks ago I added Google Analytics to the Rust Maven site and I was happy to see, that despite the site being new,
even on slow days it already has almost a 100 visitors and that this number jumps to 500 when the articles are included in [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/).
Seeing these numbers encourages me a lot. After all my goal is to help others and seeing these numbers is an indication, that at least the titles are interesting.

Getting new subscribers is an even better indication, but going from reader of the web site to sending me an email and asking to be added to the newsletter requires trust.
That's why I am grateful to you.

Anyway, 4 days ago I started to see the numbers dropping off despite sharing links on Facebook, LinkedIn and even on Reddit. I did not know what's going on.
I felt really bad. It took me 3 days to realize I accidentally removed the Google Analytics code from the site...

Yesterday I added it back and since then I can see people visiting the site again.

I'll have a blog post about this later, but now let me share a few articles with you.


## Articles

* [Turbofish ::<>](https://rust.code-maven.com/turbofish)

## Video

I am watching the video of Katharina Fey [Rust Async History, Libs, and Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqy7a6IS5yU).
A very nice historical review that makes it easier to understand the technology.
