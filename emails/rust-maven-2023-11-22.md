Hi,

I think the real professional content creators would say, spread out the new articles, but I've never managed to do that.
Today I published 4 short articles.

BTW if you feel I should add more explanations please let me know where do you feel something is missing.

* [Slurp: read content of a text file into a string](https://rust.code-maven.com/slurp)
* [Which value is smaller? Which is bigger? minimum and maximum in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/min-max)
* [How to get the smallest and biggest values from a vector in Rust?](https://rust.code-maven.com/minimum-and-maximum-element-of-vector)
* [The price of Chess is 18446744073709551615 grains of rice](https://rust.code-maven.com/price-of-chess)

enjoy!
