Hi,

I've updated the [main page](https://rust.code-maven.com/) of the Rust Maven site and added a list of major topics for which I have several articles.

* CLI
* Web
* YAML
* JSON
* Image manipulation

What topics would you be interested in?

## Articles

* A collection of [Open Source Applications written in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/applications) that we can learn from if we are to build applications.
* Several new entries in the [Clap - Command Line Argument Parser for Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/clap) series.
* [home_dir, the home directory of the current user in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/home-dir)
* [Serialize and deserialize HashMap to JSON in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/serialize-hash-to-json)


## Counter examples

* [Command line counter with plain text file storage in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/cli-counter-with-plain-text-file)
* [Command line multi-counter with storage in JSON file](https://rust.code-maven.com/multi-counter-in-json-file)


## Videos

* [A Practical Introduction to Derive Macros in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0yR6IPbhw)

## Slides

No new [Rust slides](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/)


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
