Hi,

I posted several articles:

* A list of my [Open Source Rust projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
* [Exclamation mark in Rust !](https://rust.code-maven.com/exclamation-mark) for people who are new to Rust and wonder what are those "functions" that have an exclamation mark at the end of their name.
* I think it is time to start writing about my [Rust training courses](https://rust.code-maven.com/training-course). I should even link to them from the menu.

I also started to write about deserializing JSON. I have a few more ideas for related articles, but let's start with two relatively simple ones.

* [Read arbitrary JSON without much preparation](https://rust.code-maven.com/read-arbitrary-json)
* [Read simple JSON](https://rust.code-maven.com/read-simple-json)


The article [Read arbitrary YAML files in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/read-arbitrary-yaml) I mentioned in the previous mail was featured in
the most recent edition of [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/). I hope more of my articles will be accepted for inclusion
as this one brought in more than 300 readers and several subscribers to this newsletter.

Welcome newcomers!
