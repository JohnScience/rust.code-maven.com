Hi,

Two months ago I was interviewed for The Rustacean Station Podcast.
The interview was finally posted: [Rust Digger with Gabor Szabo](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/gabor-szabo/)


Earlier I published an example embedding a text file and then using it as a CSV file in the code.
I a few suggestions for improvement and thus here is a solution in more [functional programming style](https://rust.code-maven.com/embedding-simple-csv-file-functional)
that is also probably a lot faster in Rust.


I also checked how the embedding of some text-file impacts the [size of the generated binary](https://rust.code-maven.com/compile-size).
This brought me to the realization that with the appropriate compiler flags I can reduce the size of the binary by more than 90%.


enjoy!
