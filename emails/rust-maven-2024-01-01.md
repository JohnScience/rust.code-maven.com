Hi,

In Honolulu it is still 2 more hours till they reach 2024, but most of the world has already arrived.

## Personal notes

I personally went to sleep at 11 pm just to be awoken at midnight by the air-raid sirens (now apparently called [civil defense sirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren),
not to be confused with the [mythological sirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(mythology)).) The Palestinians were shooting rockets at us reminding us that it is still more
important for them to try to kill us than to protect and feed their own children.

What they certainly don't need to remind us is that there are still **more than 100 Israelis kidnapped in Gaza**. Among them children, young women, and elderly people.

I know some of you might be surprised to see me write about something not directly related to Rust.

However, our soldiers, some of whom are fellow hi-tech employees, some of whom are part of the local Rust community are literally sacrificing their life in order to protect me, protect us.
I think I have the moral duty to use every platform I have to remind people we have this war to bring the kidnapped home and to end the constant rocket fire on our communities near the borders.
I also feel strongly that I need to thank the people who put themselves in grave danger to allow us to live a normal life. Frankly, I don't know how can I ever repay them.

I wish you a Happy New Year!

## Articles

I started writing about Rust at the end of August. At first I wrote every few days. Now I write a few every day. There are now [90 articles in the archive](https://rust.code-maven.com/archive).
I hope I'll be able to keep the pace of at least one article per day. I know for most of you reading that much, basically random articles about Rust is impossible.
My hope is that with time my articles will be properly indexed by the search engines (I use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)) and so people will find them when they need them.

I also hope to add a little search engine to the site, but it will take time. In the meantime you can check the archive or the [tags](https://rust.code-maven.com/tags/) that might help you
find the articles you are looking for.

If you have any suggestion how to make it easier, let me know.


* In the collection of [Open Source Applications written in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/applications) finally there is a web application as well. I am really glad as I am also planning to write one.

* [Temporary directory in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/temporary-directory)
* [Prompt - read input from Standard Input (STDIN) in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/prompt)

## Testing

* [Test command line application written in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/test-command-line-application)
* [Show standard output and standard error in tests in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/show-output-in-tests)

## Videos

* [RustConf 2021 - Writing the Fastest GBDT Library in Rust by Isabella Tromba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1NAREuicNs) Where GBDT = Gradient Boosted Decision Trees

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
