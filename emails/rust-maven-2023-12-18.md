Hi,

Slowly, but the number of subscribers to this newsletter is growing. Thank you for your trust!


## Articles

I wrote a number of articles on various aspects of working with YAML files in Rust. On this page I collected all the links.

* [YAML and Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/yaml)

Go ahead, try parsing a YAML file or a set of YAML files and let me know what explanations we might be missing from the series.

## Slides

No new [Rust slides](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/)

## Sharing the articles

If you like the articles you read here, please share them with others. It will be great for them and it will help me too reaching more people.
You can forward the email, share the links privately, or publicly.

Please invite others to the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) web site and to this newsletter.

## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


Enjoy!
