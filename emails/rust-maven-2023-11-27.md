Hi,

Yesterday I started to work on a new project called [Site Checker](https://site-checker.code-maven.com/).
It will help me, and hopefully many other people, analyze their web site, or their competitors web site.
Based on that analysis I'll make changes that will improve the position of my web sites.

The project is written in Rust. Obviously. It is currently a command line tool that generates a report
in JSON and HTML formats. At one point I'll probably add a GUI to it to make it more Windows-user friendly.

It is very early stages, but you are welcome to give it a try.

I [wrote about it](https://site-checker.code-maven.com/starting-the-project).

For this project I need to [parse HTML](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/parse-html.html) and also to
[get the length of a string in the Liquid template system](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/liquid-length-size.html).


Earlier I wrote a number of examples [using SQLite](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/sqlite.html) in Rust.


enjoy!
