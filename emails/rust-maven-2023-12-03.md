Hi,

Welcome to the new subscribers!

Please invite others to the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) web site and to this newsletter.

Today I played with [Loco](https://loco.rs/) The one-person web framework for Rust for side-projects and startups.
Here is how to [get started](https://rust.code-maven.com/getting-started-with-loco).
