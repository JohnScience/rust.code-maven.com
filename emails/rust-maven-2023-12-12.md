Hi,

Welcome to both the old and the new subscribers!

## How to get feedback for Rust?

IMHO One of the best ways to learn is to write an application and then to get feedback from more experienced people.
I found the [Rust users](https://users.rust-lang.org/) to be an excellent place to get answers to my questions and to get
feedback to my code. I recommend you sign up and ask questions there.

You can check out [my activity](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/szabgab/activity) to get a taste.


## Articles

For many years I was the organizer of the Israeli Perl user group, now I run several Meetup groups and I participated in many more events.
I think these are excellent opportunities to meet like-minded people and to hear interesting presentations.

That's why I created a collection of Rust user groups around the world. If you find one near-by join it and attend their meetings.

If there us no group near-by or for other reasons you cannot attend, there are a number of groups that have online meetings.

## Slides

## Video

I just listened to this panel with Mara Bos, Niko Matsakis, Jonathan Pallant at EuroRust 2023. The whole panel is interesting, but I especially liked the question, and the answers, on **how to get start to contribute to Rust itself**.
If that kind of thing is interesting to you here is the link: [Panel: Inside Rust - how to contribute](https://youtu.be/pM_c4HNiEB0?si=ZWjYlJE2sNih0Tkw&t=629)
