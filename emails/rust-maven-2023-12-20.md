Hi,


## Articles

How can you write a function that will handle all the number types? Use generic types.

* [Generic types for function parameters in Rust ðŸ¦€ ](https://rust.code-maven.com/generic-types-for-simple-function)

What if some of the parameters in a function can have default values? A little example with macros.

* [Default arguments for functions in Rust using macros](https://rust.code-maven.com/default-arguments-for-functions)
