Hi,

Welcome to the new subscribers!

Please invite others to the [Rust Maven](https://rust.code-maven.com/) web site and to this newsletter.


## Articles

* [Getting started with logging in Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/logging)
* [Resize image using Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/resize-image)
* [Create image for social networks](https://rust.code-maven.com/create-image-for-social-networks)
* [Crop image using Rust](https://rust.code-maven.com/crop-image)

## Instagram

I have never really used Instagram earlier, but I see that there are a number of Python-related accounts
with more than a million followers. So I thought I'll give it a try and create an account focused on Rust.

If you happen to use Instagram, then please follow the [Rust Maven](https://www.instagram.com/rust_maven/) there too.

If you have suggestions what kind of content works there and how to promote it, I'd be glad to hear.


## Support

I would like to justify the time I spend on writing these articles and working on the [Open source projects](https://rust.code-maven.com/projects).
Your support via [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/szabgab) would help a lot!


enjoy!
