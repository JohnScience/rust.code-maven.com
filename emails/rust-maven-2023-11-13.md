Hi,

I was hoping that I'll be able to start teaching Rust by now, but unfortunately, due to the war
that was forced upon us, all the courses in Israel are on hold.

I am quite happy working on my slides and on my open source projects, but I figured I could also
look for a remote project doing some Rust work.
So if there is a need at your company for some help with Rust development and if they are open to
remote contractors, then let's talk.

I put together a page listing my [Rust-related open source projects and activities](https://szabgab.com/rust)
and there is a more generic [about page](https://szabgab.com/about) as well.

## A few new examples

In the last couple of days I added a few more examples to the [json](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/json)
section of my slides and also added a page about [yaml](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/yaml).

The chapter about [threads](https://rust.code-maven.com/slides/rust/threads) also got a few more examples.
