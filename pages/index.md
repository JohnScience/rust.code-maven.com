Welcome to the Code Maven web site about the Rust programming language!

Both the [source of the content](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/)
and the source of the code [generating the site](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.rs) can be accessed.

The first aricle is about printing [Hello World](/hello-world).

As you can see this web site is not "ready" yet. In most cases you still see the source of the pages and not the nicely generated HTML pages.
That's because the code that generates the site was started just as I started to write content and I have not implemented everything yet.

Well, to say the truth, I hardly implemented anything.
