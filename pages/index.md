Welcome to the Rust Maven web site about, well, the Rust programming language!

Both the [source of the content](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/)
and the source of the code [generating the site](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.rs) can be accessed.

The first aricle is about printing [Hello World](/hello-world). You can find "all" the other articles in the [archive](/archive) pages.

As you can see this web site is not "ready" yet.
That's because the code that generates the site was started just as I started to write content and I have not implemented everything I wanted yet.
Not even everything my other Maven sites have.

I hope you can already enjoy the content and encourage me to improve the site and write more articles.
