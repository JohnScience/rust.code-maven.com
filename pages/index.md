Welcome to the Rust Maven web site about, well, the Rust programming language!

The first aricle is about printing [Hello World](/hello-world). You can find "all" the other articles in the [archive](/archive) pages.

The word "all" is quoted since I have started building this site only on Aug 27, 2023 and there are really not that many articles. Yet.

I hope you can already enjoy the content and encourage me to improve the site and write more articles.


Both the [source of the content](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/) and the source of the code [generating the site](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.rs) can be accessed. So if you have any requests for additinal content or features for the web site you will know where to submit those requests.
