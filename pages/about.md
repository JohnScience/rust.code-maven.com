title: About the Rust on Code Maven

This is mostly just place-holder for the about page, but I can already write some stuff here.

This site was created and is being maintained by [Gabor Szabo](https://szabgab.com/) who teaches Rust, Python, git, GitHub, GitLab, and Docker.

## The Goal

The goal of this web site is to provide explanation about the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and about
many of the [Crates](https://crates.io/).

Some people like to read specifications and terse documentation. Others, like myself, prefer fully functioning examples.
This site tends to show and explain fully functional examples. This means that in many cases we'll need to include extra
code to prepare something for feature we actually would like to show, but on the other hand you can copy the example,
start tweaking it and start using it.

## Why Maven?

Seeing the name **Maven** people something think that is has something to do with the
Java Maven, but besides using the same word in the name there is nothing common.


**Maven** is a word that came from the Hebrew "understand" word through Yiddish into **American English** where the meaning,
as I understand it, is "an expert who likes to distribute his/her knowledge". As some other people would say about me: "he talks too much".

When I first encountered the word I thought it would fit me well. It did not sound as pretentious as calling myself an "expert"
and it was connected to my roots.

Originally I created a web site called [Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/) that focused exclusively on the Perl programming language.
It became quite popular. It became the 3rd most visited Perl-related web-site, after the site hosting the documentation of the language
and the documentation of all the libraries. It is running on a Perl-based web application.

Then, when I wanted to write about other programming languages as well I created the [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) that runs on the same
code-base and covers way too many topic.

Now that I have started to write about Rust I decided to have a fresh start. The content is hosted on a separate sub-domain
and the code behind the site is being written from scratch in Rust. [source code](https://github.com/szabgab/code-maven.rs).
This of course means that many of the features that already existed in the old system are still missing, but in time I'll implement
the ones I need now.
