If someone wants to learn how to create a Rust library it is very easy to find [Crates](https://crates.io/) and see how other people do things.

However, our real goal is to create applications, or end-user applications that server other people as well. People who most likely are not Rust programmers.

One of the best ways to learn how to write end-user applications in Rust is looking at such applications. So on this page I'll try to collect a few
and as time permits I'll try to look at them and write post about them.

## GUI Applications

* [AppFlowy](https://appflowy.io/) (Flutter via custom ffi bridge, according to the Redditor)
* [Gyroflow](https://gyroflow.xyz/) (QML via qmetaobject-rs)
* [Makepad](https://makepad.nl/) See  the [Makepad Studio](https://makepad.dev/)
* [Lapce](https://lapce.dev/) Lightning-fast and Powerful Code Editor  (Floem)
* [OctaSine](https://www.octasine.com/) (Iced)
* [Psst](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst) (Druid)
* [Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) (egui)
* [Sniffnet](https://sniffnet.net/) (Iced)
* [Spacedrive](https://www.spacedrive.com/) (Tauri)
* [Loopers](https://github.com/mwylde/loopers) is a graphical live looper.
* [Helix text editor](https://helix-editor.com/)


## Command Line Tools

* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is a command line tool to create books with Markdown.
* [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) one-stop static site engine.
* [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io/) A static-site generator that works for you.

* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)


## Other

* [Moonfire NVR](https://github.com/scottlamb/moonfire-nvr) is an open-source security camera network video recorder. I personally don't have a lot of experience with hardware projects but I would like to get involved in some.


The [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) is a huge list of projects, some of them are applications. That would be a good source.

Several of these were collected via [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/18rumat/open_source_enduser_applications_written_in_rust/)
