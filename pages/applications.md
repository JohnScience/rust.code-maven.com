If someone wants to learn how to create a Rust library it is very easy to find [Crates](https://crates.io/) and see how other people do things.

However, our real goal is to create applications, or end-user applications that server other people as well. People who most likely are not Rust programmers.

One of the best ways to learn how to write end-user applications in Rust is looking at such applications. So on this page I'll try to collect a few
and as time permits I'll try to look at them and write post about them.


* [Moonfire NVR](https://github.com/scottlamb/moonfire-nvr) is an open-source security camera network video recorder. I personally don't have a lot of experience with hardware projects and I definitely would like to get involved in some.


The [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) is a huge list of projects, some of them are applications. That would be a good source.
