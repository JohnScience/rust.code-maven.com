In this example we continue the cration of simple images using the [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) Rust crate.

With this code we created two small images and drew two lines:

![veritcal green line](examples/crate-image-draw-line/green_vertical_line.png)

![horizontal red line](examples/crate-image-draw-line/red_horizontal_line.png)
