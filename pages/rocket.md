[Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) is one of the web development frameworks for the Rust programming language. It has a nice web site that comes with a nice
tutorial, but for me, to undertand it I needed my own, stand-alone examples. On this page you'll find the list of examples. You can get the full source
code of each one of them from [Rust Maven GitHub repo](https://github.com/szabgab/rust.code-maven.com/) or by following the links above the files.
