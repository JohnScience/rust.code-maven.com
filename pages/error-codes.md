The rust compiler provides detailed error messages and then also refers to an error code.
We can use the `rustc --explain` command to show the explanation for each error message or
we can visit the [Rust error codes index](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/) where we can find
all the codes and the explanations.


On this page I'll list all the codes that were mentioned in the various articles.

* [E0425](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0425.html) - [Rust error message to fix a typo](/error-message-to-fix-typo)
